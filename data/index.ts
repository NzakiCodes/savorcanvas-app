    fullrecipe: `Jollof rice is a popular West African dish known for its flavorful, one-pot preparation. Here are the basic steps to prepare jollof rice:

    Ingredients:
    - 2 cups long-grain parboiled rice
    - 1/4 cup vegetable oil
    - 1 onion, finely chopped
    - 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
    - 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
    - 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
    - 1 teaspoon ginger, minced
    - 1 can (14 oz) of tomato sauce or blended tomatoes
    - 1 tablespoon tomato paste
    - 2 teaspoons paprika
    - 1 teaspoon thyme
    - 1 teaspoon curry powder
    - 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
    - 2-3 bay leaves
    - 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
    - Salt and black pepper to taste
    - Optional: protein of your choice (chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc.)
    
    Instructions:
    
    1. Rinse the Rice:
       - Wash the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.
    
    2. Prepare the Base:
       - Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or skillet over medium heat.
       - Add the chopped onions, red and green bell peppers, and sauté until they become soft and translucent.
    
    3. Add Aromatics:
       - Stir in the minced garlic and ginger. Cook for another minute or until fragrant.
    
    4. Tomato Sauce and Paste:
       - Add the tomato sauce or blended tomatoes and tomato paste to the pot. Stir well.
       - Cook the tomato mixture for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and the oil starts to separate from the sauce.
    
    5. Seasonings:
       - Add the paprika, thyme, curry powder, cayenne pepper, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper. Mix to combine and cook for another 5 minutes.
    
    6. Add Rice and Broth:
       - Pour in the washed and drained rice, and stir to coat it evenly with the tomato mixture.
       - Add the chicken or vegetable broth and stir well. You can also add your choice of protein at this point.
    
    7. Simmer:
       - Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for about 25-30 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
    
    8. Check for Doneness:
       - Check the rice for doneness. It should be tender and have absorbed the liquid. If it's still too firm, add a bit more broth or water and continue to cook, covered, until it's done.
    
    9. Serve:
       - Once the rice is done, remove the bay leaves and fluff the rice with a fork.
       - Serve your jollof rice hot, garnished with additional chopped bell peppers or other toppings of your choice.
    
    Enjoy your delicious homemade jollof rice! It's a flavorful and satisfying dish that's perfect for gatherings and celebrations.`,

    fullrecipe: `Fried rice is a versatile and delicious dish that's popular in many Asian cuisines. Here's a simple recipe for preparing basic fried rice:

    Ingredients:
    
    - 2 cups of cooked and cooled rice (day-old rice works best)
    - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    - 1 onion, chopped
    - 2 cloves garlic, minced
    - 1 carrot, diced
    - 1/2 cup frozen peas
    - 2 eggs, beaten
    - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
    - 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)
    - Salt and pepper to taste
    - Optional protein (e.g., cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu)
    - Optional garnishes (e.g., chopped green onions, sesame seeds)
    
    Instructions:
    
    1. **Prepare Ingredients:**
       - Cook and cool the rice in advance. Cold rice works best for fried rice as it's less likely to become mushy.
       - If you're adding protein, make sure it's cooked and cut into bite-sized pieces.
       - Chop the onion, garlic, and carrot. Thaw the frozen peas.
    
    2. **Heat Oil:**
       - Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
    
    3. **Sauté Vegetables:**
       - Add the chopped onion and sauté for a few minutes until it becomes translucent.
       - Stir in the minced garlic and diced carrots. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the carrots start to soften.
    
    4. **Add Protein (Optional):**
       - If you're adding protein like cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu, add it to the skillet and stir-fry until it's heated through.
    
    5. **Push Vegetables and Protein Aside:**
       - Push the vegetables and protein to one side of the skillet, creating an empty space on the other side.
    
    6. **Scramble Eggs:**
       - Pour the beaten eggs into the empty side of the skillet. Scramble them with a spatula until they're mostly cooked but still slightly runny.
    
    7. **Combine Ingredients:**
       - Now, mix everything in the skillet together, including the scrambled eggs.
    
    8. **Add Rice:**
       - Add the cold, cooked rice to the skillet. Break up any clumps and stir-fry to combine it with the other ingredients.
    
    9. **Season with Soy Sauce:**
       - Drizzle the soy sauce (and optional sesame oil) over the rice. Stir well to evenly distribute the sauce.
    
    10. **Add Frozen Peas:**
        - Toss in the thawed frozen peas and stir-fry for an additional 2-3 minutes until everything is heated through.
    
    11. **Season to Taste:**
        - Taste the fried rice and season with salt and pepper as needed. Be cautious with salt if your soy sauce is very salty.
    
    12. **Garnish and Serve:**
        - If desired, garnish your fried rice with chopped green onions and sesame seeds.
        
    13. **Serve Hot:**
        - Serve your homemade fried rice hot as a side dish or as a meal on its own.
    
    Feel free to customize your fried rice by adding other vegetables, proteins, or seasonings to suit your preferences. It's a flexible dish that can be adapted in many ways.`,

    fullrecipe: `Cooking pasta is a simple and versatile process. Here are the basic steps for preparing pasta:

    Ingredients:
    
    - Pasta of your choice (e.g., spaghetti, penne, fusilli)
    - Water
    - Salt
    - Optional: Olive oil
    
    Instructions:
    
    1. **Boil Water:**
       - Fill a large pot with water. You'll need enough water to fully submerge the pasta. Generally, about 4-6 quarts of water per pound of pasta is a good rule of thumb.
       - Place the pot on the stove over high heat and bring the water to a rolling boil.
    
    2. **Add Salt:**
       - Once the water is boiling, add salt to the boiling water. A general guideline is to use about 1 to 2 tablespoons of salt per gallon of water. This helps flavor the pasta.
    
    3. **Add Pasta:**
       - Carefully add the pasta to the boiling water. Stir immediately to prevent the pasta from sticking together.
    
    4. **Cook Pasta:**
       - Follow the instructions on the pasta package for cooking times. Cooking times vary depending on the type and thickness of the pasta.
       - Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking.
    
    5. **Test for Doneness:**
       - About a minute or two before the recommended cooking time is up, start testing the pasta for doneness. It should be "al dente," which means it's cooked but still has a slight firmness when bitten.
       - Use a fork to remove a strand of pasta, allow it to cool slightly, and taste it. If it's done to your liking, remove it from the heat. If not, continue cooking and testing in 1-minute intervals.
    
    6. **Drain Pasta:**
       - Once the pasta is cooked to your satisfaction, turn off the heat.
       - Carefully, using oven mitts or a towel, pour the contents of the pot into a colander or strainer in the sink to drain the water.
    
    7. **Optional: Rinse (for cold pasta dishes):**
       - If you're making a cold pasta salad or similar dish, rinse the pasta under cold running water to cool it quickly and stop the cooking process. This also removes excess starch.
    
    8. **Toss with Olive Oil (optional):**
       - For some dishes, you might want to toss the cooked pasta with a little olive oil to prevent sticking, especially if you're not using it immediately.
    
    9. **Serve and Enjoy:**
       - Serve the cooked pasta immediately with your favorite sauce, whether it's marinara, pesto, Alfredo, or any other sauce of your choice.
    
    Remember that pasta cooking times can vary slightly depending on your altitude and the specific brand and type of pasta you're using. Taste-testing is the best way to determine if it's done to your liking. Enjoy your pasta!`,
